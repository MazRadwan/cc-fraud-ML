# Machine Learning Capstone Project Outline: Fraud Detection

- when creating a new cell !!Create the mardown description!! and explanation for new


## Step 1: Project Initialization
- Create a new directory and open it in VSCode.
- Set up a virtual environment:
  ```bash
  python -m venv ml-fraud-env
  source ml_fraud/bin/activate
  ```
- Install required packages:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost imblearn plotly shap
  ```
- Create and open a Jupyter Notebook within VSCode.

## Step 2: Data Loading and Initial Exploration
- Import required libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
- Load dataset (`creditcard_2023.csv`) into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Examine dataset structure:
  - `df.head()`
  - `df.info()`
  - `df.describe()`

## Step 3: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Check for missing values and handle them if necessary.
- Detect and remove duplicate rows.
- Analyze the distribution of the `Class` column to identify class imbalance.

## Step 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize class imbalance (bar chart/pie chart).
- Plot histograms and density plots of `Amount` and PCA features (`V1`â€“`V28`).
- Generate a correlation heatmap of features.

## Step 5: Feature Engineering and Data Preprocessing
- Normalize or scale the `Amount` feature.
- Address class imbalance using techniques:
  - SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)
  - Random undersampling or oversampling.
- Split data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20 split).

## Step 6: Model Selection and Training
- Evaluate multiple algorithms:
  - Logistic Regression (baseline model).
  - Random Forest Classifier.
  - XGBoost Classifier.
  - Support Vector Machine (optional based on computational resources).
  - Multi-Layer Perceptron (Neural Network, optional).
- Train models using cross-validation and compare performance metrics.

## Step 7: Hyperparameter Tuning
- Apply GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV for tuning model hyperparameters.
- Optimize models based on precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC metrics.

## Step 8: Model Evaluation and Comparison
- Generate confusion matrices.
- Plot ROC and Precision-Recall curves for comparison.
- Summarize evaluation metrics clearly in a table.

## Step 9: Model Interpretability
- Use feature importance methods (Random Forest/XGBoost feature importances).
- Use SHAP values to interpret feature impact.
- Discuss insights and limitations due to anonymized data.

## Step 10: Final Model Selection
- Select the best-performing model based on evaluation criteria.
- Provide rationale for selection, emphasizing trade-offs.

## Step 11: Model Interpretability and Visualizations
- Use SHAP values to illustrate feature influence.
- Create detailed visualizations clearly communicating key insights.

## Step 12: Conclusion and Documentation
- Summarize findings and outcomes.
- Discuss limitations and potential improvements.
- Clearly document the entire process within the Jupyter Notebook.
